  "FAQ": {
    "FAQ": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "Others": "Others",
    "q_why_build": "Why build JSON For You?",
    "a_why_build1": "Most similar sites only support the most common validate, format, minify, escape, unescape and tree view features, a small number of sites provide a structured comparison. But few sites provide BigInt comparison, text comparison, in-line comparison, array difference comparison, so I made JSON For You to address it.",
    "a_why_build2": "After two years of use, I found that JSON For You is good enough to process JSON data, but it is not convenient to view JSON data. For example, when encountering a complex JSON structure, JSON For You can quickly view the formatted text, but only the text form can't let developers quickly understand the JSON structure. Therefore, I have launched JSON For You 3.0.0, which provides two view modes: graph view and table view. For complex object type data, you can quickly understand it through the graph view, and for complex array type data, you can quickly understand it through the table view.",
    "q_support_features": "What features does JSON For You support?",
    "a_support_features1": "JSON Validation - Automatically validates when modified. Error lines will be marked, and sufficient context will be provided to help locate errors.",
    "a_support_features2": "JSON Formatting - Automatically formats when dragging files or pasting, even if the JSON data is invalid.",
    "a_support_features3": "JSON Minimization - Removes all whitespace characters, compressing the JSON data into a single line.",
    "a_support_features4": "JSON Escaping - Escapes JSON data by adding \\ characters to make it a valid string.",
    "a_support_features5": "JSON Unescaping - Unescapes JSON data by removing \\ characters to make it valid JSON.",
    "a_support_features6": "JSON Sorting - Recursively sorts keys but does not sort arrays; the JSON before and after sorting is semantically equal. Commonly used for comparison after sorting, allowing diffs to be grouped together for easier visual inspection.",
    "a_support_features7": "Display JSON Path - Clicking anywhere will show the corresponding token's JSON Pointer. Used in conjunction with the minimap, it helps quickly understand the structure of the JSON.",
    "a_support_features8": "CSV to JSON - Converts CSV files to JSON, supporting both header and no-header cases.",
    "a_support_features9": "JSON to CSV - Converts JSON arrays into CSV files.",
    "a_support_features10": "URL to JSON - Recursively parses a URL into JSON. If you need to compare the diff of two URLs, converting them to JSON first makes it very convenient.",
    "a_support_features11": "BigInt/int64 Comparison - In business development, IDs are often defined as int64, while JS's number can only accurately represent 52-bit integers. Without special handling on the front and back ends, precision can be lost. To quickly identify such differences, BigInt comparison functionality is supported.",
    "a_support_features12": "Word-by-Word Comparison - Sometimes two JSON data sets have only minor differences, such as two long strings that differ by only one or two words, making it difficult to visually identify the specific inconsistencies. Therefore, word-by-word comparison is supported, allowing you to easily spot the exact diffs.",
    "a_support_features13": "Array Diff Comparison - If two JSON arrays have differences, we generally do not need to view the diff of every single element, as there may be a lot of noise that is inconvenient for visual inspection. Therefore, a diff comparison is provided, offering a concise, human-readable difference similar to git diff.",
    "a_support_features14": "Text Comparison - Since text comparison is also a common requirement, support has been added to downgrade invalid JSON to text comparison (text diff), providing an experience similar to git diff.",
    "q_what_is_jq": "What is jq and how to use it in JSON For You?",
    "a_what_is_jq": "jq is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text. JSON For You support to use jq online (version 1.7), you can input \"jq\" in the quick command bar to use it.",
