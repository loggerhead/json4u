## Communications

By establishing an Account on our Service, you consent to receive newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, and other information we may disseminate. However, you may opt out of receiving any or all of these communications by following the unsubscribe link or by contacting us.

## Purchases

Should you wish to procure any product or service offered through the Service (“Purchase”), you may be required to provide certain information pertinent to your Purchase, including, but not limited to, your credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and shipping information.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you possess the legal authority to utilize any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and (ii) the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and truthful.

We may engage third-party services to facilitate payment processing and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you authorize us to share such information with these third parties in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including, but not limited to: product or service availability, inaccuracies in the description or pricing of the product or service, errors in your order, or other reasons.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraudulent or unauthorized activity is suspected.

## Subscriptions

Certain components of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing Cycles are established either monthly or annually, depending on the subscription plan you select at the time of purchase.

At the conclusion of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same terms unless you cancel it or JSON For You terminates it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal via your online account management page or by contacting the JSON For You customer support team.

## Free Trial

JSON For You may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited duration (“Free Trial”).

You may be required to provide billing information to enroll in the Free Trial.

If you enter your billing information upon signing up for the Free Trial, you will not incur charges from JSON For You until the Free Trial has expired. On the final day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancel your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the selected Subscription type.

At any time and without prior notice, JSON For You reserves the right to (i) modify the Terms of Service of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) terminate such Free Trial offer.

## Fee Changes

JSON For You, at its sole discretion and at any time, may adjust Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any change in Subscription fees will take effect at the end of the current Billing Cycle.

JSON For You will provide reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to allow you the opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such changes take effect.

Your continued use of the Service following the implementation of any Subscription fee change constitutes your acceptance of the modified Subscription fee.

## Refunds

Unless explicitly stated during the Purchase, all payments are non-refundable except as mandated by law.

## Content

Our Service enables you to post, link, store, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other materials (“Content”). You are solely responsible for the Content you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.
