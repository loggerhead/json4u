# How to Format JSON?

JSON For You provides a powerful JSON formatting (also known as JSON beautification) function, which supports both automatic and manual methods to help developers quickly beautify JSON data and improve readability. By default, JSON For You will **automatically format the JSON data when you type or paste it**. This means you can get well-structured and neatly indented JSON code without any extra operations.

If you do not need automatic formatting and want to format manually, you can also follow these steps:

1. Paste the original JSON string into the left editor;
2. Click the "Auto Format" button on the sidebar to turn it off;
3. Click "Search Command" at the top, find "**Format**", and click to perform manual formatting.

## Use Cases for JSON Formatting

Standard JSON format is crucial for the following scenarios:

- **Team Collaboration**: Improve the readability of JSON for multi-person development;
- **Troubleshooting**: Quickly locate syntax errors and structural problems;
- **API Development**: Ensure the correct format of request/response data;
- **Documentation**: Create easy-to-understand JSON examples.
