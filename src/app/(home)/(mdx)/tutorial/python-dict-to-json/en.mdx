# How to Convert Python Dict to JSON?

The key-value pair structure of a Python dict is very similar to that of JSON, but there are differences in syntax and data types. If you need to visualize or process a python dict, you can first convert it to JSON and then use the powerful JSON editing and visualization features on JSON For You. The steps are as follows:

1. Paste the original JSON string into the left editor;
2. Click "Search Command" at the top, find "**Python dict to JSON**", and click to execute.

Since there are significant differences between python dict and JSON, JSON For You currently only supports simple text replacement, so converting complex dicts may fail.

## Example

**Python dict:**

```python
{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'is_student': False,
    'hobbies': ['reading', 'coding', 'hiking'],
    'address': {
        'street': '123 Main St',
        'city': 'Anytown'
    },
}
```

**Converted JSON:**

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "is_student": false,
  "hobbies": ["reading", "coding", "hiking"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  }
}
```
