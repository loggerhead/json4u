# How to Import or Export CSV?

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text format widely used for storing tabular data, while JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a very popular data exchange format in web development. In different application scenarios, you may need to convert data between CSV and JSON.
