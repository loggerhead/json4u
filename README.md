## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve performance to support large files (>= 1mb).
  - [ ] Only render visible nodes in graph mode.
  - [ ] Use virtual list or canvas to render in table mode.
  - [ ] Use wasm in web worker for parsing (use rust).
  - [ ] Consider [changing the editor to Ace or CM6](https://medium.com/miro-engineering/how-we-integrated-a-code-editor-on-the-miro-canvas-a41e0eff7f21).
- [ ] Improve interoperability between left and right panels.
  - [ ] Support [search](https://www.fusejs.io/demo.html) in graph mode (synchronize reveal between left and right panels).
  - [ ] Support search via JSON path (synchronize reveal).
  - [ ] Support modifications in view mode.
  - [ ] Support synchronize fold and unfold between left and right panels.
  - [ ] Support displaying the key count of an object/array node after folding.
- [ ] Add a group API to support file upload and retrieval.
  - [ ] Support share with an expiration date.
  - [ ] Support auto upload local files to server.
  - [ ] Provide a command line tool ([#24](https://github.com/loggerhead/json4u/issues/24)).
  - [ ] Provide vscode plugin.
  - [ ] Support preprocessing via jq before fetch.
- [ ] Integrating AI to provide certain functions (under research).
  - [ ] Integrating basic AI capabilities in server side.
- [ ] Support jsonc and jsonl.
  - [ ] Design the UI for jsonl.

## Setup

1. Run `pnpm install` in repo's root folder.
2. Run `pnpm dev` to run the development server.
3. Open [http://localhost.json4u.com:3000](http://localhost.json4u.com:3000) with your browser to see the result.
4. Make changes to the code and see the result in the browser.

If you want to test webhook:

1. Install whcli: `npm install -g @webhooksite/cli`.
2. Get token from [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).
3. Run `whcli forward --target=http://localhost.json4u.com:3000 --token=TOKEN_YOU_GET`

## Contribution Guide

I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing to JSON For You. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide:

1. Search for the `TODO` keyword in the code first. If it's found, then you can work base on it directly.
2. Otherwise:

   - If you want to add a new feature, provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.
   - If fixing bug, provide a description of the bug in the PR.
   - Other minor changes that don't affect the logic of the code, such as fixing typos, translating comments into English, and adding comments, are all welcome. Just submit a PR.

3. I wish to keep JSON For You lightweight and fast. Please being aware of the number of npm dependencies and their size and don't add **unnecessary** dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm test` to make sure your code pass the core tests.
